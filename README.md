# js-macaroon

A JavaScript implementation of [macaroons](http://theory.stanford.edu/~ataly/Papers/macaroons.pdf) compatible with the [Go](http://github.com/go-macaroon/macaroon), [Python, and C ](https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons) implementations. Including functionality to interact with third party caveat dischargers implemented by the [Go macaroon bakery](http://github.com/go-macaroon-bakery/macaroon-bakery).

This is a maintained port of the awesome work by Roger Peppe on the original [js-macaroon](https://github.com/go-macaroon/js-macaroon) project.
